Analysis of the pattern:

/x\
xxx
\x/

Where the outer corners are
fixed and the x's are all
flippers.

Summary: this pattern always results in a 90 degree
rotation.

Of course the family of patterns is symmetric, so this
means that whatever direction you enter from, you
will leave rotated by 90 degrees.

It is impossible for a pattern of this kind to either
turn the ball straight around, or to allow it to pass
straight through.

(We can prove this easily without resorting to
exhaustion:
     a
    ABA
   aBABa
    ABA
     a

The ball is initially in state a, and will end
up in state a. Transitions are a->A, A->B, B->A, B->a.
Clearly the ball must visit a capital letter an odd
number of times. Since direction changes (only) when
visiting a capital letter and then always by 90 degrees,
the direction is changed by 180n + 90 degrees, that is,
90 or 270 degrees.)

An interesting thing about the pattern is that running
the ball after travelling through the pattern leaves it
in another configuration in the same family.

I haven't yet studied the way the patterns transition
into each other compared to the output rotation.
