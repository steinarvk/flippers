* Metrics
** Noninteractive connections (bad)
Amount of connections in the final puzzle that the player has
no opportunity to influence (e.g. zero distance so can't
place a block between them).
** Long stretches (bad)
Amount of distance travelled beyond 1 tile after each bounce.
E.g. a bounce + 1 tile space + a bounce + 1 tile space is
"free". A bounce + 5 tile spaces costs 4.
** Dull pieces (bad)
Number of pieces in the final solution that have other pieces
in no more than two other directions.
** Omitted piece path confusion (good)
For each omitted piece in the puzzle (solution - puzzle):
  Number of bounces before the ball leaves the board, after
  it would have hit the omitted piece
Hard cap at the complexity of the puzzle.
** Complexity (good)
Number of bounces in the final solution
** Twice-hit pieces (good)
Number of times a piece is hit beyond the first time in
the final solution.
** Uniqueness (boolean, required)
There are no solutions except the proposed solution.
